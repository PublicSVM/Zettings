#Zettings
This program lets you switch LiveSplit settings based on the game you are playing.

If your LiveSplit folder is located in Downloads, it'll work out of the box.
You can also set the path to the folder in `Zettings.exe.config`

PS. There is a good chance this will not work if your LiveSplit folder is located in Program Files.
